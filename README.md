# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.

## How to successfully run this application

The tests are as follows:
	
1. Tests to check that allFeeds variable has been defined and is not empty.
2. Loops through each feed in allFeeds to make sure that each URL is defined and not empty
3. Loops through each feed in allFeeds to make sure that each name is defined and not empty.
4. Checks that the menu element is hidden by default.
5.
